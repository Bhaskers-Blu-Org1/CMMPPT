# make a list of all of the variables used in the makefiles specified

# format makeNameList.sh fn1 fn2 ...
# where the fn's are names of makefiles to scan

# Note: it would be better to write this in perl, but this was a quickie.
# Bug: makeNameList only pics up one variable per line,
# even if there are multiple, and it doesn't ignore comment lines.

# The cat command concatenates all of the input files and sends them to stdout
# The 1st sed command filters out all of the lines except the ones that contain
# a string starting with $( ending with ) and having only letters, numbers,
# and underscores between them.  For the lines having such strings, it sends
# the characters between the parens in the first such string to stdout.
# The 2nd sed command makes lines to print out the variables names and values
# The last line (the subshell) sends "print_vars:" and then the lines from
# the 2nd sed command to stdout
