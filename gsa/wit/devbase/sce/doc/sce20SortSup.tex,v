\title{(Operation-less) INTERFACE FOR SORTING FUNCTIONALITY \\
       Supplemental to the \\
       Supply Capability Engine (SCE) Data Model Release 2.0}
\author{Tom Ervolina (ERVOLINA at YKTVMV), 
Robin Lougee-Heimer (RLH at YKTVMV) \and Dan Connors  (DPC at YKTVMV)}
\date{March 14, 1997\footnote[2]{This document was 
formatted on \today\ at \hhmm.}}
\maketitle
The data model for SCE Release 2.0 enables very general modeling of
co-product production through the introduction of {\em operations}. A
special case of co-product production is {\em sorting}. By sorting we
mean the case where a single (untested) part number is sorted into a
variety of (tested) part numbers. Due to the one-to-one relationship
between part numbers to be sorted and sorting operations, the SCE
operation input files for a sorting model can be automatically
generate from input information which does not explicitly mention
{\em operations}. The benefit of this is that it reduces the complexity of
the input data.
 
This document describes the (operation-free) user input files for
sorting and how the necessary SCE release 2.0 input files can be
generated from them. This document assumes the reader is familiar with
the data model for release 2.0.  The following items are
important:
\begin{enumerate}

\item Part numbers to be sorted are unique from part numbers
which are produced from the sort.

\item A part number is sorted once and only once.
 
\end{enumerate}

{\bf Usage Notes:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Any (part number, pdf) entry appearing in the Sort
Distribution File, Sort Yield File, Sort Lot Size File or Sort BOC 
File must be defined in the Part Definition File.
\item Any (capacity name, pdf) entry appearing in the Sort BOC
File must be defined in the Capacity Definition File.
\item The Sort Yield File allows the user to explicity state the yield
when sorting a part number. A Sort Yield File entry
 \begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lllll}
  ``00000ABC123'', &``970'', &0.9, &start, &end
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
signifies that if 100 units of part 00000ABC123 are sorted, ($100*0.9=$)
90 units will pass and ($100-90=$) 10 units will be lost due yield.

The distributions rates specified in the Sort Distribution File are
applied to the post-yield quantities. Continuing the example, suppose we
also had the following entries in the Sort Distribution File
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{llll}
  ``00000ABC123'', &``00000ABC111'', &``907'', &0.1 \\
  ``00000ABC123'', &``00000ABC222'', &``907'', &0.6 \\
  ``00000ABC123'', &``00000ABC333'', &``907'', &0.3
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Together with the yield, this signifies that if 100 units of part
00000ABC123 are sorted, ($100*0.9*0.1=)$ 9 units of 00000ABC111 will be
produced, ($100*0.9*0.6=$) 54 units of 00000ABC222 will be produced, and
($100*0.9*0.3=$) 27 units 00000ABC333 will be produced. 

Notice that in this example the distribution rates for
part 00000ABC123 sum to 1.0. The distribution rates for a part need
not sum to 1.0. Commonly, the distribution rates sum to less than
1.0, with the remainder being regarded as yield loss.

For example, suppose the Sort Distribution File entries for part
00000XYZ789 were
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{llll}
  ``00000XYZ789'', &``00000XYZ111'', &``907'', &0.09 \\
  ``00000XYZ789'', &``00000XYZ222'', &``907'', &0.40 \\
  ``00000XYZ789'', &``00000XYZ333'', &``907'', &0.27
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The  sum  of the distribution rates for part 00000XYZ789  is
($0.09+0.40+0.27=$) 0.76. If no entries for part 00000XYZ789 are made in
the Sort Yield File  (so, the sort  of  this part assumes the  default
yield  of  1.0)  then  this signifies  that  if  100 units  of   part
00000XYZ789  are  sorted   ($100*1.0*0.09=$)  9 units    of 00000XYZ111,
($100*1.0*0.4$) 40 units of 00000XYZ222, and ($100*1.0*.27=$) 27 units of
00000XYZ333  are produced, with the remainder ($100-9-40-27=22$ units)
attributed to yield loss.

We caution the user againist entering yield information both in the
Sort Distribution File (as distribution rates for a part summing to
less than 1.0) and in the Sort Yield File, as this can lead to
unintentional ``double counting'' of the yield.
