@Optimized Value Planning Tool (OVPT)

In this directory you should find:
  -readme.txt:     This file
  -ovpt.exe:       The executable program which reads the input
                   data files and writes the output data files.

  -mclDll.dll,
   witDll.dll,
   msvcp70.dll,
   msvcr70.dll:    
   mclgDll.dll,
   witgDll.dll,
   msvcp70d.dll,
   msvcr70d.dll,
   oslmd6030.dll:   Dll's used by ovpt.exe

  -doc\acetylStreamModel.ppt: Charts of the model
  -doc\fileFormats.doc: Definition of file formats.
  
  -example1: directory containing sample input files
  -example2: directory containing sample input files
             for Acid Con 3 and Template.
  -example3: directory containing sample input files
             which match doc\acetylStreamModel.ppt.
             (the numeric values other than period,
             are just place holders and need to be 
             updated).
  -example4: directory containing input data files
             provided by Eastman. These are the files
             from the example3 directory that have
             been populated with the numeric values.

To run the ovpt executable:
- open a DOS window
- change to the directory eastmanDistribution
- enter the command:
    ovpt
  or
    ovpt example1

After running ovpt you should see the solution output files 
in the same directory as the input files.
