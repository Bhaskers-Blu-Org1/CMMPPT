In this directory you should find:
  -readme.txt:     This file
  -rcpOptMain:     The executable program which reads the input
                   data files and writes the output data files.
  -rcpOpt.h:       Header file that exposes the api.
  -rcpOptException.h:  Header file that exposes the api of thrown exceptions.
  -rcpOptDll.h     Header file used by other header files to properly access the dll.

  -rcpOptMain.cpp: Source code for rcpOptMain.exe which is an example
                   usage of the api.

  -librcpOpt.a.:   Link library for application using the api

  -libwit.a:       Library required when linking with librcpOpt.a
  
  -example_finalformat: directory containing input files


To run the rcp executable:
- change to the directory rcpOptDistr
- enter the command:
    rcpOptMain
  or
    rcpOptMain example_finalformat

After running rcpOptMain you should see the solution output files 
in the same directory as the input files.
