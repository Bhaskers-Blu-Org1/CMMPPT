@Added location to the engagement.  So the examples had to be updated.  There are now fields in bom.csv and engagement.csv for the location of the engagement.  The resourceaction.csv file does not yet have location information.  I am not sure why CVS is updating it.

@added new examples (very simple) in example3. Also changed various routines

we could have a routine to supply the actual start time.
