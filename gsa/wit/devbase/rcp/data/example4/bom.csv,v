* there are two jobroles requested, r1 and r2. Each also has
* two location possibilities, l1 and l2. r1 is allowed to be substituted
* with r1a; r2 is not allowed to be substituted. l1 can be substituted
* (for both resources) by l1a; l2 cannot be substituted. This should also
* allow us to check handling of "only one substitution allowed" vs 
* "multiple substitutions allowed"
* Finally LOB and skillset must match 
* (and has no substitution) while source does not
* have to match (with no penalty for substitution)
