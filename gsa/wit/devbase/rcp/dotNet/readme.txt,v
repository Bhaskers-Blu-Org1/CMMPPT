@Updated to remove distribution of dsp and dsw files.
These have not been tested with change in API name and should no longer be needed because Keith is now building code on windows and aix
@

In this directory you should find:
  -readme.txt:     This file
  -rcpOptMain.exe: The executable program which reads the input
                   data files and writes the output data files.
  -rcpOpt.h:       Header file that exposes the api.
  -rcpOptException.h:  Header file that exposes the api of thrown exceptions.
  -rcpOptDll.h     Header file used by other header files to properly access the dll.

  -rcpOptMain.cpp: Source code for rcpOptMain.exe which is an example
                   usage of the api.

  -rcpOptdll.lib:  Link library for application using the api
  -rcpOptgdll.lib: Same as rcpOptdll.lib except that it is built with debug

  -rcpOptdll.dll   The dll associated with rcpOptDll.lib
  -rcpOptgdll.dll  The dll associated with rcpOptgdll.lib

  -mclDll.dll,
   witDll.dll,
   msvcp70.dll,
   msvcr70.dll:    Dll's used by rcpOptdll.dll

  -mclgDll.dll,
   witgDll.dll,
   msvcp70d.dll,
   msvcr70d.dll:   Dll's used by rcpOptgdll.dll

  -oslmd6030.dll:  Dll used by rcpOptdll.dll and rcpOptgdll.dll

  
  -example_finalformat: directory containing input files

To run the rcp executable:
- open a DOS window
- change to the directory rcpOptDistr
- enter the command:
    rcpOptMain
  or
    rcpOptMain example_finalformat

After running rcpOptMain you should see the solution output files 
in the same directory as the input files.
