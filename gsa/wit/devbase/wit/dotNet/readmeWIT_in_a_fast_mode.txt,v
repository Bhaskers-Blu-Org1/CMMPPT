@Instructions how to build WIT using COIN in a "fast" mode.
@
text
@witdll.dll builds in a Released mode.

To build it in a "fast" mode with COIN modify the line in the preprocessor definitions to be: 

_WINDOWS;DISGUISE=0;DEVELOPMENT=1;OSLMSDLL;EXE_TYPE=fast;WIN32;NDEBUG,COIN_BUILD

This line is located at:

Project Properties -> C/C++ -> Preprocessor -> Preprocessor Definitions@
