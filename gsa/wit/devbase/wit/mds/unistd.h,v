@Changes to have wit build with witParse.C, witLexer.C and ytab.h moved from mds directory to src directory
@
text
@/* 
  This file is needed for the windows build because wit/src/witLexer.C 
  includes unistd.h.
  unistd.h is available on most platforms but not MS windows.
  On windows contents of unistd.h are not needed for the compile to work.

  Since witLexer.C is generated with lexx and yacc it would be difficult
  to remove the include o unistd.h just for windows.

  The implemented solution is to just include this empty file in the windows
  build search path
