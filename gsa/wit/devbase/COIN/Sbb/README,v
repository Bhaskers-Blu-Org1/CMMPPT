@To build Sbb see INSTALL file

To use Sbb you need the Sbb, Cgl, Coin and Osi libraries.  You
will probably need Clp as well.

To make the unitTest and standalone executable do

make unitTest in this directory.  This creates an executable sbb.

Running sbb gives you some hints.  Just do 

sbb -
 
and then try ? or setting various stuff.

On Linux sbb can do file completion and line editing.  

While the competition is on no work is being done on the sbb driver.  You
should look at the samples.

There are samples in ./Samples.  Use the corresponding Makefile to 
create an executable - testit.

At present there are only two useful samples.

sample.cpp  This is a simple program to read an mps file.and solve the
		integer problem.

sample2.cpp.  This is the benchmark driver for the competition.  It overrides
		the default branching methods and adds a (mildly useless)
		heuristic.  It is intended to show you how to add your
		own methods.  See SbbCompareUser.hpp for how to modify
		choice of node from tree.  See SbbBranchUser.?pp for
		how to modify which variable is chosen at a node.  For
		more complex stuff such as new types of branches see
		SbbBranchBase and SbbBranchActual in directory Sbb.
		To see how to add heuristics see SbbHeuristicUser.?pp.

		To add cut generators - define them as in Cgl and then just
		add them as in sample2.cpp

	***	At present this driver solved 44 miplib3 problems in
		less than 30 minutes maximum and a just over two hours total 
		(1.7 ghz Pentium 4).  A few more can be solved in longer
		or by changing options.  This version corresponds to
		cvs tag sbb-0-60-0 i.e. version 0.60.0

		The script "runtimes" in Samples directory will
		run some or all of test set.  The version checked in
		does some - just take off # to run.  An optional time
		in minutes can be passed.

	Further discussion will appear on coin-contest.
