/*! \class forcing_constraint_action
    \brief Detect and process forcing constraints and useless constraints

  A constraint is useless if the bounds on the variables prevent the constraint
  from ever being violated.

  A constraint is a forcing constraint if the bounds on the constraint force
  the value of an involved variable to one of its bounds. A constraint can
  force more than one variable.
