    Really nothing can be generalized for warm start information --- all we
    know is that it exists. Hence the abstract base class contains only a
    virtual destructor and a virtual clone function (a virtual constructor),
    so that derived classes can provide these functions.

/*! \class CoinWarmStartDiff
    \brief Abstract base class for warm start `diff' objects

  For those types of warm start objects where the notion of a `diff' makes
  sense, this virtual base class is provided. As with CoinWarmStart, its sole
  reason for existence is to make it possible to write solver-independent code.
