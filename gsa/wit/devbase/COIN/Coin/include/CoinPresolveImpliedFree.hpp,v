    \brief Detect and process implied free variables

  Consider a singleton variable x (<i>i.e.</i>, a variable involved in only
  one constraint).  Suppose that the bounds on that constraint, combined with
  the bounds on the other variables involved in the constraint, are such that
  even the worst case values of the other variables still imply bounds for x
  which are tighter than the variable's original bounds. Since x can never
  reach its upper or lower bounds, it is an implied free variable. Both x and
  the constraint can be deleted from the problem.

  The transform also handles more complicated variations, where x is not a
  singleton.
