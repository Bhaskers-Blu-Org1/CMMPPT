@Instructions to build libraries or example codes from COIN:

First get the code:
  - cd ~   (or some other directory of your choice -- for the rest of this
	    file it is assumed that COIN is installed in your home directory)
  - cvs checkout COIN  (see http://www.coin-or.org/faqs.html#cvsUsage)
    or 
    download and unpack the tarball file.

You should now have a subset of the following directories (depending on what
you have downloaded)
  - ~/COIN 
  - ~/COIN/Makefiles - various global and system dependent Makefiles
  - ~/COIN/Coin - a library containing a set of core classes, functions.
  - ~/COIN/Vol - the Volume Algorithm
  - ~/COIN/Clp - the Coin LP solver
  - ~/COIN/Osi - the Open Solver Interface
  - ~/COIN/Cgl - the Cut Generation Library
  - ~/COIN/Sbb - the Simple Branch and Bound solver (now it's branch and cut)
  - ~/COIN/Bcp - the Branch-Cut-Price framework
  - ~/COIN/Examples/* - Sample programs
  - ~/COIN/Mps - *.mps files
  - ~/COIN/Ots - the Open Tabu Search framework
  - ~/COIN/Dfo - the Derivative Free Optimization
  - ~/COIN/Ipopt - Interior Point Non-linear optimizer

To build any component (library or example code), see the INSTALL file
in that directory (except for Ipopt, where the INSTALL file is in
~/COIN/Ipopt/doc)

After installing any of the libraries two more directory will be created: 
  - ~/COIN/include - the header files of the installed libraries
  - ~/COIN/lib     - the installed libraries

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
================

1) One of the most important files is ~/COIN/Makefiles/Makefile.location.
   This file contains definitions for which libraries you want to build and
   the location of libraries that might be needed (e.g., zlib to read
   compressed MPS files). Please look at this file before starting to install
   anything.

2) Also, take a look at the ~/COIN/Makefiles/Makefile.<your_system_type>
   file. This specifies what compiler to use and what compiler flags.
