@		witXML Documentation

	witXML provides tools for wit to read/write file in XML format.

	Function "witXMLRead" reads an input XML file for a WitRun.

	Function "witXMLWrite" generates an output XML file from a WitRun. It can be used to convert a wit input file from text format into XML format.

	These tools are developed on the basis of XML tools ( developed by the Apache Software Foundation (http://www.apache.org/).") and the standard wit public interface (wit.h).

	The XML file format for wit is defined in file "wit.dtd".

	The witXML includes 4 library files:
		libicu-uc.a,
	       	libicudata.a,
		libxerces-c1_3.a,
		libwitXML.a.
The first 3 files are located in /u/wit/power43/lib. The last one is in /u/wit/liusz/witXML/power43.

	Head files of this project are located in
		/u/wit/power43/include/xml
	
	Source codes of witXML are located in
		/u/wit/liusz/witXML/src

	To generate witXML library and test code, go to
 		/u/wit/liusz/witXML/power43
and type
		/usr/gnu/bin/make all.
The library file "libwitXML.a" and the test code "unitTest" will be generated.
		
	This XML file format uses XML's predefined entities to escape the characters from element or attribute content. They are:
	"&lt;" for left angle bracket "<",
	"&gt;" for right angle bracket ">",
	"&amp;" for ampersand "&",
	"&apos;" for single quote "'",
	"&quot;" for double quote """.
Therefore, when convet a text file into xml format, the above characters will be replaced by the corresponding predefined entities.
