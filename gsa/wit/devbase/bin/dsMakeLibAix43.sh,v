@dsMakeLibAix43.sh and dsMakeLibAix5.sh are almost the same;
the only difference is the absolute path name used for makeC++SharedLib.
In older versions of the compiler, this utility is in /usr/ibmcxx/bin;
in Visual Age C++, it is in /usr/vacpp/bin.  The utility is apparently
not installed in the standard bin directory, so we can't rely on the
user's path to find it.

@#!/bin/ksh -x

# This is a translation of the C-shell script dsMakeLibAix43 into ksh.
# I did this because the C-shell script was having mysterious
# problems when I compiled on an AIX v5 system.
#
# The lines setting linkerFlags and files caused csh (on crab.yamato.ibm.com)
# to either hang or segfault; crab is an AIX 5 machine.
# I tried working around this, but it seems that if there are more
# than 25 "words" in a value to be assigned to a variable,
# then csh segfaults.  25 is just the value I got; perhaps it
# is actually the number of characters, or something else.
#
# This is pretty much a word-for-word translation, with one exception:
# I didn't hard-code the path for makeC++SharedLib.
# That means that this script should also be useable for 
# other systems.  However, I've left it as a separate script for now.
#
# in the csh script, "set echo" is used to tell csh to start
# printing commands.
# I don't know how to do this in ksh, if it can in fact be done.
# instead, I just have it print all executed commands with the "-x" flag.
# I've left the set and unset commands in, but commented-out the unset
# commands, since they return a non-0 status if the variable being unset
# is not in fact set.

# Make a library

# This command is designed to be used on AIX.  It can be changed to work
# on other operating systems too, but it doesn't do that right now.
