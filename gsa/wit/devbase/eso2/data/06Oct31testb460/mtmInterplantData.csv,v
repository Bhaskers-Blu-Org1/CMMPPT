*-----------------------------------------------------
* This file defines the valid MTM interplant movements you want ESO2 to be able to move between
* NTDSI supply source loc's and the De-Mfg source Loc's. 
*
* sourceLoc - is the supply location where suplly will be moved from
* destLoc - destination location,  is the location the supply will be moved to.
*
* If you do NOT define E2E valid interplant movements (Path/highway)
* ESO2 can not move supply to from demand loc, even if ESO2 finds a match 
*
* MoveCost - cost to move MTM supply from on lease back to an IGF DeMfg/ReMfg site is 0.0, happens anyway
* MoveTime - time to move MTM supply from on lease back to an IGF DeMfg/ReMfg site is 0.5 weeks, added skew to be safe
* MoveCost - cost to move MTM supply between IGF MTM Invetory at sites w/in same site/GEO's is $50.00
* MoveTime - time to move MTM supply between w/in same site/GEO's 1.0
*
* Note: we do NOT allow movement of machines between GEO's 
*
* Dummy De-Mfg Loc's allow ESO2 more accurately track & report the supply source loc's
* for parts that require machine to be moved to De-Mfg to pull a Part or feature to satisfy demand.
*
* For Persihibility function to work for Inventory IGF on lease or Machine Inventory youmust immediately
* move a machine from on lease ( GLN, GLE, GLA, GLL ) or a machine inventory to the defined dummy DeMfg location
* as its first MTM interplant movement.
**-------------------------------------------------------------
* Begin defining IGF lease machine interplant movements to dummy De-Mfg source loc's
