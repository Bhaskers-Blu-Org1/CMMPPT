--------------------------------
How to Build and Run "WitJDemo1"
WIT-J Deployment Case
--------------------------------

This document explains how to build and run the example WIT-J application
program "WitJDemo1". The procedures described here are for use in a context in
which WIT-J has been acquired for deployment (perhaps through e-mail).

This document describes two (very similar) procedures: one for Linux and one for
Windows.

One good way to build and run your own WIT-J application program would be to
generalize from one of procedures given here.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Linux Case
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assumptions:

* The executables "javac" and "java" for Java version 6.0 are in your path.

* The following files have been acquired:

  libwitj.so      This is the native library that contains the C++ portion of
                  WIT-J (including WIT) for use on Linux.

  witj.jar        This is the Jar file that contains the Java portion of WIT-J.

  WitJDemo1.java  This is the Java source code for the example WIT-J
                  application program WitJDemo1. WitJDemo1 is the example
                  program given in the WIT-J Application Developer's Guide.

Procedure:

1. Put libwitj.so, witj.jar, and WitJDemo1.java on some directory.

2. cd to the directory.

3. To compile WitJDemo1, enter:
      javac -cp witj.jar WitJDemo1.java
   
4. To run WitJDemo1, enter:
      java -cp .;witj.jar -Djava.library.path=. -ea WitJDemo1

Alternatively, you can put libwitj.so and witj.jar in different directories.
In this case:
   The -cp option must give the path name of witj.jar.
   The -Djava.library.path option must give the directory of libwitj.so.

Alternatively, you can use Eclipse and specify the class path and native library
path similarly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows Case
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assumptions:

* The executables javac.exe and java.exe for Java version 6.0 are in your path.

* The following files have been acquired:

  witj.dll        This is the native library that contains the C++ portion of
                  WIT-J (including WIT) for use on Windows.

  witj.jar        This is the Jar file that contains the Java portion of WIT-J.

  WitJDemo1.java  This is the Java source code for the example WIT-J
                  application program WitJDemo1. WitJDemo1 is the example
                  program given in the WIT-J Application Developer's Guide.

Procedure:

1. Put witj.dll, witj.jar, and WitJDemo1.java on some directory.

2. cd to the directory.

3. To compile WitJDemo1, enter:
      javac -cp witj.jar WitJDemo1.java
   
4. To run WitJDemo1, enter:
      java -cp .;witj.jar -Djava.library.path=. -ea WitJDemo1

Alternatively, you can put witj.dll and witj.jar in different directories.
In this case:
   The -cp option must give the path name of witj.jar.
   The -Djava.library.path option must give the directory of witj.dll.

Alternatively, you can use Eclipse and specify the class path and native library
path similarly.
