To build the Mkc sample code:
  - First must have built the Vol and Osi modules. 
    See Vol/INSTALL and Osi/INSTALL below the COIN root directory
  - cd back to this directory
  - Read and edit the makefile as necessary
  - make
     - must use gnu make. 
     - Targets are put in subdirectories.
       The name of the target subdirectory is derived using uname 
       command and some compiler flags.

To run the code
  - gunzip the problem file (mkc.tgz)
  - ./TARGET_SUBDIRECTORY/bcps bcp.par
    where TARGET_SUBDIRECTORY is the name of the subdirectory 
    containing the bcps executable. For description on the parameters 
    see the documentation in Bcp/Doc/Manual in the COIN root directory.
