To build the BranchAndCut sample code:
  - look at and if necessary, edit COIN/Makefiles/Makefile.location
  - look at and if necessary, edit COIN/Makefiles/Makefile.<your_system_type>
    this file specifies the compiler and the default flags
  - make
     - this will check whether all the necessary other COIN libraries are
       installed and if not, it will build them.
     - must use gnu make. 
     - Targets are put in subdirectories.
       The name of the target subdirectory is derived using uname 
       command and some compiler flags.

To run the code on an instance provided by Michael Junger:
  - ./TARGET_SUBDIRECTORY/bcps bb.par
