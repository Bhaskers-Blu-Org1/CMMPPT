=============================================================================
Release:                  IPOPT Version 2.0.1           (as of July 24, 2002)
=============================================================================

The files of this package are available from the COIN-OR web page at
http://www.coin-or.org .  They can be obtained via CVS or as tarballs
(see http://www.coin-or.org/download.html).

The package is released under the Common Public License (CPL); see
http://www.opensource.org/licenses/cpl.html or the enclosed LICENSE
file.

This package contains the components

- IPOPT  : An interior point algorithm for large-scale nonlinear
           optimization (with interfaces to AMPL and CUTEr)
- DYNOPT : A set of routines for automatic discretization of a system
           of differential and algebric equations, that can be posed
           as constraints in the optimization problem to allow the
           optimization of dynamic systems.
- DYNOPC : A user interface for convenient solution of dynamic
           optimization problems. (under development)

For more information on the individual components, see README.IPOPT
and README.DYNOPC.

For detailed information on how to install and compile components of
the IPOPT package see the INSTALL file.  Here, also the dependencies
to third party software components are described.  For information on
compiling under Windows, read the README.Windows file.

If you just want to quickly build a solver executable for AMPL, read
the QUICKINSTALL.AMPL file.  The QUICKINSTALL.CUTEr file describes how
you can use IPOPT within CUTEr.


As stated in the license, you can use the provided code without
charge, but if you modify the code and you distribute your
modifications in some way (as source code or as binaries), you must
make those modifications public, indicating which changes you made.
For details, see the LICENSE file.

Finally, if you are publishing results that are obtained by using
IPOPT, we ask you to mention this in your publication.


HELP:  If you have trouble installing or using the code, you may sent
       a message to the coin-ipopt mailing list accessible at
       http://www.coin-or.org/mail.html .  If you believe you found a
       bug, you mail file a bug report at
       http://www-124.ibm.com/developerworks/bugs/?group_id=30

NOTE:  The source code might continuously updated in the CVS
       repository, which will reflect the next day in the dated
       tarballs.  From time to time we will issue a new version
       number, and a tarball with that version number will be
       available in the tarball directory.

NOTE:  Since the authors are not sure how much interest will be in
       using this software, the documentation is not 100% complete.
       If you are interested in using this package and feel that
       certain parts of the documentation are not clear enough, please
       send a message to the coin-ipopt mailing list.

       Furthermore, the code has been release under an open source
       license in order to encourage contributions.  If you are
       interested in adding components (e.g. interfaces to different
       linear algebra solvers), please let us know!
