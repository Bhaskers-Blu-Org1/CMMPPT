<P>
<B>Q: What is DFO?</B> 
<P>
A: DFO is a Fortran package for solving general nonlinear optimization problems that have the following characteristics: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>they are relatively small scale (less than 100 variables),
<LI>their objective function  is relatively expensive to 
compute and derivatives of such functions are not available and
<LI>cannot be estimated efficiently.
</UL>
<P>
There also may be some noise in the function evaluation procedures. 
Such optimization problems arise ,for example, in engineering design, where 
the objective function evaluation is a simulation package treated as a black box.
<P><B>Q: What if I have a constraint function that is expensive to evaluate and whose derivatives are not available?</B> 
<P>A: A new version of DFO which handles such problems will be available soon. Meanwhile the user can try to put the &quot;difficult&quot; constraint into the objective function with a penalty term and handle the penalty function
management themselves externally.
<P><B>Q: What if the objective function evaluation fails for certain values of the variables? </B> 
<P>A: We refer to such situation as &quot;virtual&quot; constraint; i.e. constraint
whose value cannot be computed at all. All the information that is available about
such a constraint is whether it is violated or not. The user has an option to return a
 &quot;fail=true&quot; flag if the objective function cannot be  computed
at a given point. The user should not assign artificially high values to
the objective function at such points because this can seriously affect
the efficiency of the algorithm.
<P><B>Q: Is it useful to use DFO if the functions are inexpensive to evaluate?</B> 
<P>A: Yes, but the runs will not be very efficient if the problem size is close to 100 rather than close to 20.
<P>A version of DFO for problems with inexpensive function evaluations is under development.
<P><B>Q: Does it matter if the underlying problem is essentially smooth or not?</B>
<P>A: Maybe. The theory behind the algorithm assumes that derivatives exist but are not available. 
In practise the algorithm can be applied when derivatives do not exist.
<P><B>Q: Will DFO find me a global minimum?</B>
<P>A: Maybe, but the algorithm is designed only to find local minima. In any case the user should run it from a variety of starting points. 
Because of the general approach the method has a tendency not to converge to &quot;poor&quot; local optima.
<P><B>Q: Are there any publications on DFO?</B>
<P>A: Yes.

<P>
<B>Q: What platforms does DFO run on?</B>
<P>A: DFO has been tested on:
<UL>
<LI>AIX V4
<LI>Linux 
</UL>
<P><B>Q: What do I need to install DFO?</B>
<P>A: To run DFO the user needs to have 
the <A HREF="http://www.netlib.org/blas/">BLAS</A> routines and the <A HREF="http://www.netlib.org/lapack"> LAPACK</A> routines which are not distributed with the open source. In addition
DFO uses a derivative based optimization package to solve a trust region
minimization subproblem on every iteration. In theory any general purpose gradient based
nonlinear optimization package can be used, if an appropriate interface is provided.
Currently there is are interfaces for the FORTRAN 77 package <A HREF="http://www.sbsi-sol-optimize.com/NPSOL.htm">NPSOL</A> and for the C package
<A HREF="http://gachinese.com/aemdesign/FSQPframe.htm">CFSQP</A>. The user can  independently obtain either of these packages or
develop their own interface with a different package.
<P><B>Q: How do I test if I installed DFO correctly?</B>
<P>A: There are 7 test problems from the Hock and Schittkowski test set that are provided with
DFO. See the README file for instructions on running the tests.
