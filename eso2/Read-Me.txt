Directory "eso2" in the WIT-Projects RTC stream
-----------------------------------------------

The subdirectories of this directory were copied from a checkout of the eso2
directory of our old CVS repository on 11/9/11.

The following files were not copied from CVS, because they were binary:

   data/example3/example3.ppt
   data/example4/example4.ppt
   data/example5/example5.ppt
   doc/fileFormats.lwp
   doc/witModel.ppt

The following directories were not copied from CVS, because the corresponding
platforms were not currently supported by WIT:

   dotNet713
   mds
   powerVac

All of the ESO2 files (both those copied to RTC and those not copied) still
exist on CVS on GSA.
