* This file contains the De-mfg cost & cycle time for ESO2 to use
* when it aquires an MTM from IGF MTM lease supply source loc's and/or
* IGF MTM plant inventory supply source loc's. It covers the cost and time to
* move them from the Inventory supply location into the IGF DeMfg location, perform Demfg  
* operations to recover the parts or features and move the recovered parts or features to
* the IGF loose piece inventory supply locactions for the parts or features recovered.

*    Note: In order for ESO2 to use this data, you must define 
*    in the MTM interplant file an MTM interplant movements to move
*    supply from the IGF MTM source loc to the IGF De-Mfg loc you desire. 
*    You must also define a Part Interplant movement in the partInterplant.csv
*    file to move the part from De-Mfg Loc to the part demand custloc location
