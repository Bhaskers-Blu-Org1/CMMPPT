WIT1054W The solution status code returned by CPLEX indicates that the MIP
         solve routine terminated early, but it did find an integer feasible
         solution to the MIP problem. WIT will use it to compute the implosion
         solution.
         
            Solution Status Code: 104
            Solution Status:      "solution limit exceeded"
