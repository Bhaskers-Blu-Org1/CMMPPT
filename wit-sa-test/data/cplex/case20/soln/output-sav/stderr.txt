WIT1051W The solution status code returned by CPLEX indicates that the LP solve
         routine terminated early. Nevertheless, it did find a primal feasible
         solution and WIT will use it to compute the implosion solution.
         
            Solution Status Code: 10
            Solution Status:      "iteration limit exceeded"
