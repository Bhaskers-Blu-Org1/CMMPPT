# CMMPPT (Constrained Materials Management and Production Planning Tool)
This software enables determination of optimal allocation of scarce resources when the resources are consumed in "kits" corresponding to sets of parts (for example a bill of material) and/or a set of capacities (for example, specifically skilled technicians) . It could also be used in analytical decision making to optimally determine if equipment is worth selling as whole or dismantled for service parts
