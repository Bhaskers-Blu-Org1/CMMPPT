How to Build and Run "WitJDemo1"
WIT-J Development Case
--------------------------------

This document explains how to build and run the example WIT-J application
program "WitJDemo1". The procedure described here is for use in a context in
which WIT-J has been set up for WIT-J development.

The procedure is to run two scripts. Thus to fully understand how this procedure
works, you'll need to read the content and comments in these scripts.

One good way to build and run your own WIT-J application program would be to
generalize from the content of these two scripts.

At present this document applies to the following platforms:

   * Linux
   * Windows SDK
